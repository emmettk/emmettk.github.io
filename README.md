[WHOI To-Do List](https://emmettk.github.io/todo-whoi.html) - What I'm currently up to at work; mostly for my/my colleagues' reference. 

## Personal Projects 
A loosely-organized directory of my non-work-related technical projects.
### Data Science-Related Projects
#### [Human Factors](https://emmettk.github.io/HumanFactors/HumanFactorsDivingReport.html)
This is a project I am working on with the WHOI dive department to study human factors in diving - specifically, how factors such as temperature, visibility, experience level, task loading, etc, influence dive outcomes and diver performance. (This repository is private for now to protect the privacy of the divers until the data is aggregated but a short writeup of some recent work is available at the link.) 
#### [Technical Accidents](https://github.com/emmettk/TechnicalAccidents)
This is a work-in-progress project attempting to mathematically model the distribution of skydiving fatalities by the level of problem experienced by the jumper vs their level of competence responding to it, the idea being that the probability of a fatality depends on the probability of a certain level of mishap and the probability of a certain level of compentent responce. This project is currently mostly for my own entertainment rather than serious data science. 
#### [Tensorflow Examples](https://github.com/emmettk/TensorFlowExamples)
Some simple tensorflow examples and related notes. Work in progress.
#### [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/emmettk/LogisticRegression)
Some examples of logistic regression will go here eventually. Work in progress.
#### [Bamboo Shoots](https://github.com/emmettk/bamboo-shoots)
This is where I put pandas-related notes and examples. Work in progress.

### ROS (Robot Operating System)
These repositories are my own versions of the tutorials for the following class, which I took at WHOI in Nov/Dec 2017.
[https://dscl.lcsr.jhu.edu/home/courses/ros_short_course_fall_2017/](https://dscl.lcsr.jhu.edu/home/courses/ros_short_course_fall_2017/)
- [Module 1](https://github.com/emmettk/beginner_tutorials)
- [Module 2](https://github.com/emmettk/learning_tf)
- [Module 3](https://github.com/emmettk/joy_twist)
- [Module 4](https://github.com/emmettk/edumip_my_robot)
- [Module 5 and 6](https://github.com/emmettk/edumip_my_robot_gazebo_ros)

### Physics Projects
#### [Physics From Scratch](http://www.physicsfromscratch.xyz)
I wrote some educational materials for learning quantum electrodynamics (e.g. calculating scattering amplitudes) without (much) prior mathematical or physics experience. I taught this class to high school students as part of MIT's HSSP educational program. Eventually those materials will make their way up here.
#### Neutrinos
I used to work on [KamLAND](http://www.awa.tohoku.ac.jp/kamlande/) and I did an undergraduate thesis on joint detection of supernovae using gravitational waves and neutrinos (back before gravitational waves were confirmed to exist!) 
No clear joint events so far, but we're keeping a [look out!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07155)

#### Dark Matter
I did some undergraduate research on bound dark matter states called [wimponium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07617)


### Miscellaneous Hobby-Related Drabbles
#### [Emergency Medicine](https://github.com/emmettk/EMT)
Emergency medicine-related drabbles. Currently this is just a little quiz program for my NREMT recert exam. 
#### [Diving](https://github.com/emmettk/diving)
Diving-related drabbles. Some calculators and decompression table-related code. 

### Miscellaneous Programming Drabbles
#### [Mornington Crescent](https://github.com/emmettk/MorningtonCrescent)
I like this silly programming language and sometimes I play with it.
#### [C# Circles](https://github.com/emmettk/csharp_circles)
I was learning C# for a job and this was my first program. It draws fun mathematically-colored circles.
